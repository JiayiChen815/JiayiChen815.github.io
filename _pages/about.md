# 🙋🏻‍♀️ About Me
I am a master's student at Northwestern Polytechnical University, supervised by [Prof. Yong Xia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Usw1jeMAAAAJ) and [Assoc. Prof. Hengfei Cui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SQbO8oQAAAAJ). My recent research focuses on active learning and federated learning in medical image analysis.
